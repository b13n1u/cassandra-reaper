      <description>Adding a Cluster Enter an address of one of the nodes in the cluster, then click Add Cluster Reaper will contact that node and find the rest of the nodes in the cluster automatically.
      
Once successfully completed, the Cluster&amp;rsquo;s health will be displayed.

If JMX authentication is required and all clusters share the same credentials, they have to be filled in the Reaper YAML file, under jmxAuth (see the configuration reference).</description>

      <description>Authentication Authentication is activated in Reaper by default. It relies on Apache Shiro, which allows to store users and password in files, databases or connect through LDAP and Active Directory out of the box. The default authentication uses the dummy username and password as found in the default shiro.ini. It is expected you override this in a production environment.
This default Shiro authentication configuration is referenced via the following block in the Reaper yaml file :</description>

      <description> Checking a Cluster&amp;rsquo;s Health Dashboard When a cluster has been added to Reaper it will be displayed in the dashboard.

      <description>Operating with a Multi DC Cluster Reaper can operate a cluster which has a multi data centre deployment. The datacenterAvailability setting in the Reaper YAML file indicates to Reaper its deployment in relation to cluster data center network locality.
Single Reaper instance with JMX accessible for all DCs In the case where the JMX port is accessible (with or without authentication) from the running Reaper instance for all nodes in all DCs, it is possible to have a single instance of Reaper handle the whole cluster by using the following setting in the configuration yaml file :</description>
